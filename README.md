wheres-my-internet
==================

"Where is my Internet?" is a very simple android application whose sole purpose is to provide the user with information regarding area-specific internet connections. It also gives the user the idea of internet speed/strength and whether these internet connections are password protected or not.

The information is crowd sourced and is being pushed to the server whenever the user connects to a specific wifi connection.
